Refinements Needed

Admin Dashboard (usability)

Missing quick Match Start/End controls.

Needs bulk import/export (CSV/Excel).

No notifications system yet (to push updates to referees/live page).

Referee Panel

Scoring works, but needs:

Undo last point option.

Pause/Resume button (useful mid-match).

Confirmation before ending a match.

Live/Public Page

Leaderboard refresh is still manual — needs WebSockets or timed refresh.

No “Now Playing” sticky banner.

Sponsor/ad slots not yet built in.

DB Layer

Schema is solid, but might need match events/history table
